# The Year That Broke Everything: A Father's Fight Against Systematic Retaliation

*A First-Person Account by James Patrick White*

## The Breaking Point: December 2024

I thought I understood corruption. After walking away from a quarter-million-dollar job in 2019 because I couldn't sell products I didn't believe in, I believed I'd seen the worst of institutional dishonesty. I was wrong. Nothing prepared me for what began on December 16, 2024, when Pierce County, Wisconsin, seized my infant daughter based on what I would later prove was entirely fabricated evidence.

My partner Erin and I had fled to Wisconsin seeking refuge from financial predators who were systematically destroying my 86-year-old father. We were exhausted—Erin had just endured a harrowing premature birth after 3.5 weeks of hospitalization, followed by severe postpartum depression. Our beautiful daughter Genevieve was healthy and thriving, but we were financially and emotionally depleted from months of trying to protect my father from what I now know was a coordinated scheme of elder exploitation.

On December 27, 2024, they presented us with a toxicology report claiming our 10-month-old daughter had methamphetamine levels exceeding 20,000 pg/mg in her hair—levels that would be lethal to an adult, impossible for a living infant. The report looked official, bore laboratory names, but something felt wrong. As someone with FINRA Series 7 and 63 licenses who had been trained to detect fraud, I knew I was looking at something that defied both science and logic.

## The Digital Forensics Discovery: January 2025

By January 3, 2025, when they returned the "results," I began my investigation. What I discovered through digital forensics analysis would expose a conspiracy that reaches far beyond a simple custody dispute. The metadata of the PDF documents revealed they were created using consumer software—Microsoft Word, PDFSharp, Telerik Reporting—on personal computers, not in certified laboratories. The "author" listed in the documents was Dustin Klanderman, the collection agent, not laboratory personnel.

This wasn't a case of questionable evidence—this was proof of outright fabrication. No legitimate laboratory had ever tested our samples. The levels reported for both Genevieve and myself (299,807 pg/mg) were not just high—they were scientifically impossible for living persons, exceeding published literature by 200-300%.

## The Authentication Demand: June 27, 2025

Armed with this evidence, I filed a formal demand on June 27, 2025, requesting authentication of the toxicology evidence. I specifically requested:
- Original Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) data
- Raw instrument files
- Complete chain of custody documentation
- ISO-17025 certification and scope
- Analyst qualifications
- Sworn custodian declarations

This was not an unreasonable request—it's standard protocol for challenging forensic evidence. What happened next revealed the depth of the conspiracy.

## The Admission: August 6, 2025

On August 6, 2025, during a recorded Google Meet conference, Pierce County DHS caseworkers Megan Johnson and Kim Stensland made shocking admissions. When I pressed them about the authentication evidence, they stated they had been instructed by their legal counsel that they were "not authorized" to provide the documents I requested. When I asked why visitation had been moved to an inferior location, Johnson explicitly admitted it was because of my "interactions"—my requests for authenticated evidence.

This was a recorded admission of First Amendment retaliation by government officials—punishing me for exercising my constitutional right to challenge evidence and seek redress.

## The Pattern of Retaliation

But the Pierce County situation was just the latest chapter in a coordinated campaign of retaliation that began in 2018 when I first reported predatory lending against my elderly father. The timeline is clear:

**2018**: I reported First Bank Blue Earth for predatory lending against my cognitively declining father
**April 13, 2024**: I filed regulatory complaints about a $6,000 loan my father claimed was used to pay a "coyote" for human trafficking
**April 2024**: Martin County charged me with terroristic threats (Case 22-CR-24-284) for alleged messages sent to the banker within hours of filing regulatory complaints
**November 2024**: We fled to Wisconsin to escape financial predators
**December 2024**: Pierce County seized Genevieve based on fabricated evidence
**June 27, 2025**: I demanded authentication of evidence
**August 6, 2025**: Pierce County admitted retaliation in recorded meeting
**September 14, 2025**: I filed a pre-litigation demand documenting the violations
**September 18, 2025**: In direct retaliation, Martin County filed new criminal charges (46-CR-25-845) and I was jailed for six days
**September 25, 2025**: Pierce County suspended all visitation based on my arrest

## The Criminal Charges: Tools of Intimidation

The criminal charges against me tell the real story. In April 2024, within days of filing complaints about suspected human trafficking loans, Martin County charged me with terroristic threats. The alleged messages were sent to the same banker I had just reported to federal regulators—a banker who was financing what my father believed was human trafficking.

Then in September 2025, just days after I filed formal legal demands documenting Pierce County's constitutional violations, Martin County filed new charges (46-CR-25-845). I was arrested and held for six days—not because I posed any genuine threat, but because I was getting too close to exposing their coordination.

The charges are based on emotional messages sent to my father while watching financial predators strip him of his life savings and my daughter being held based on fabricated evidence. Yes, I was angry. Yes, I said things I regret. But these were not criminal threats—they were the desperate words of a son and father watching his family be systematically destroyed by institutions that are supposed to protect us.

## The Elder Exploitation Connection

While I've been fighting fabricated charges and trying to see my daughter, the predators have continued their assault on my 86-year-old Vietnam veteran father. First Bank Blue Earth has now extracted over $380,000 from him despite my repeated warnings about his cognitive decline. EdgeWater Investment Group has defrauded him of another $53,000. 

The bank obtained a receivership over his assets while I was trapped in Wisconsin proceedings, unable to protect him. Every time I've tried to intervene, new criminal charges appear. This isn't coincidence—it's coordination.

## The Constitutional Crisis

For 287 days and counting, my daughter has been held based on evidence I have proven was fabricated. Pierce County has denied every request for authentication, refused discovery for 242 days, and admitted to retaliating against me for demanding constitutional due process.

This case represents a fundamental breakdown of the justice system:
- **Fabricated Evidence**: Digital forensics prove the toxicology reports were created on personal computers, not in laboratories
- **Scientific Impossibility**: The reported drug levels exceed survivable limits by 200-300%
- **Due Process Violations**: 242 days of discovery denial, authentication refusal, retaliation for constitutional challenges
- **First Amendment Retaliation**: Recorded admissions of punishment for protected speech
- **Coordinated Prosecution**: Criminal charges timed to filing of constitutional challenges

## The Federal Response

On September 26, 2025, I filed an emergency petition with Governor Walz documenting this systematic retaliation. The pattern is clear: every time I report criminal conduct or exercise constitutional rights, new charges appear to silence me.

I am now preparing federal civil rights litigation under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging this systematic violation of constitutional rights. This isn't just about one family—it's about whether institutions can fabricate evidence, deny due process, and retaliate against whistleblowers with impunity.

## The Human Cost

The statistics can't capture what this has done to our family. Genevieve has now spent more of her life separated from me than with me. I haven't been able to hold my daughter, read her bedtime stories, or simply be her father for most of her first year of life—all based on evidence that was never real.

My 86-year-old father is being stripped of everything he worked for while I'm prevented from protecting him through fabricated charges. Erin faces potential arrest and separation from our daughter. I've been denied my ADHD medication based on fabricated evidence, causing severe functional impairment that makes it difficult to work or even think clearly.

## Why I Keep Fighting

I could have accepted a plea deal. I could have stayed quiet and hoped they'd eventually return my daughter. But that would mean accepting that institutions can fabricate evidence against families, that retaliation against whistleblowers is acceptable, that constitutional rights are optional.

I keep fighting because love without proof is just hope, but love with proof is a promise. I promised Genevieve I would never stop fighting for truth, no matter the cost. I promised my father I would expose those exploiting him. I promised Erin we would hold these institutions accountable.

## The Broader Mission

This experience has transformed my understanding of justice in America. The same skills I used in financial services—detecting fraud, analyzing data, following money trails—are now tools for constitutional accountability. Every document they've hidden, every procedure they've violated, every lie they've told is documented.

This is why I'm building Nora's Law—not as vengeance, but as prevention. We're creating transparent, statistical methods to identify patterns of institutional abuse that can't be explained away or managed into silence. When denial requires defending statistical impossibilities, the conversation changes.

## The Promise

To Genevieve: Daddy never stopped fighting. Every day you were gone, I was building evidence and demanding accountability. When you're old enough to read this, you'll know that some things are worth every sacrifice—and you are worth everything.

To institutions that think they can silence whistleblowers with fabricated charges and retaliation: You picked the wrong family. I have the skills, the determination, and now the proof to expose everything you've done. Justice delayed is not justice denied when the evidence is this strong.

To families facing similar retaliation: You are not alone. Document everything. Fight back with facts. Demand proof. Make them defend their actions in the light.

This year broke everything I thought I knew about justice in America. But from that breaking came clarity about what must be built: systems of accountability that can't be corrupted, evidence standards that can't be fabricated, and transparency that can't be hidden.

The fight continues. The evidence is overwhelming. Justice is coming.

*Day 287 and counting. We will not be silenced.*
